You are an expert Python programmer.
Write a Python code that defines a function named `solve` which takes one argument:
- a list of numbers (each element is an integer or a float).
The code must:
- return the sum of the numbers in the list,
- return 0 if the list is empty,
- raise a TypeError if any element is not a number,
- not import external libraries unless strictly required.
Important formatting rules:
- Output only valid Python function code, nothing else.
- Enclose the code between <python_code> and </python_code> tags.
- Do not add explanations, comments, or test case.
