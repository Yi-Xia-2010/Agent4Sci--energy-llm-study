You are an expert Python programmer.
Write a Python code that defines a function named `solve` which takes two arguments:
- two 2D lists of numbers (integers or floats) representing matrices.
The code must:
- return the matrix product of the two inputs,
- raise a ValueError if dimensions do not match for multiplication,
- raise a TypeError if elements are not numbers,
- not import external libraries unless strictly required.
Important formatting rules:
- Output only valid Python function code, nothing else.
- Enclose the code between <python_code> and </python_code> tags.
- Do not add explanations, comments, or test case.
